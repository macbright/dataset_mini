This is a Dataset for uploading csv, tsv etc to a backend server. below are the features the app has: 

1) Import the dataset
	The user has the option of dragging and dropping a dataset or pressing an â€˜Uploadâ€™ button.

2. Tweak the dataset settings
	The user can choose to exclude some columns from being imported. They also have the
	option of marking a column as:
	- ID (unique identifier),
	- Name (what each row will be called), or
	- Timestamp (date associated with each row)
	Marking a column does not change the column name. Additionally, at most only one
	column can be marked as ID/Name/Timestamp, and one column cannot have multiple
	marks. For example, a column cannot be marked as both ID and Name.
3. Check for any formatting errors within the dataset columns
	This is the final check before the data is imported to the system. The system checks if the IDâ€™s are unique and whether all Timestamp entries are convertible to date format, among other things
